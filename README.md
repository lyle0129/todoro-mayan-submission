## 💡 Inspiration

Born from a React learning exercise, To-doRo evolved from a simple to-do list into a comprehensive productivity tool. The name combines "To-do" with "Pomodoro" (Italian for tomato 🍅), referencing the time management technique created by Francesco Cirillo.

The Pomodoro Technique helps break work into focused intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. This method reduces mental fatigue and maintains consistent productivity throughout the day.
